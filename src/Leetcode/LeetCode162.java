/**
 * Find Peak Element
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
 * <p>
 * Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element,
 * and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks,
 * return the index to any of the peaks.
 * <p>
 * You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words,
 * an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a
 * neighbor that is outside the array.
 * <p>
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
