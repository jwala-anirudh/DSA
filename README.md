# DSA in Java

Welcome to the Java Data Structures and Algorithms repository!

This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in Java, along with LeetCode solutions and personal learning notes. All the code in this repository is open-source and available for anyone to use or contribute to.

The Data Structures included in this repository are:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Binary Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

The Algorithms included in this repository are:
- Searching and Sorting Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking Algorithms
- Divide and Conquer Algorithms
- Bit Manipulation

In addition to the code implementations, this repository also includes solutions to LeetCode problems related to Data Structures and Algorithms. Each solution is explained in detail and accompanied by the relevant code.

Furthermore, this repository also contains personal learning notes on each Data Structure and Algorithm, which can be used as a reference for anyone looking to learn or refresh their knowledge.

I welcome contributions from anyone looking to improve or add to the existing codebase. Thank you for visiting!
